Proton Racing - Rules 
Game Rules

Keep the car on track by manipulating the car's position and speed, if the vehicle goes off the track, then it is game over!

The goal is to try and get the best time (lowest time) after going around the track 3 laps

Driving must be performed in a counter-clockwise fashion (NO CHEATING!)

Ensure to control your speed around the corners, remember, inertia is a thing that even affects proton racers!

Most importantly, remember to stay positive (even when you crash, you can always just play again!) 

Have Fun!
